# OpenStreetMap Vecto

ðŸš§ ðŸš§ Work in progress ðŸš§ ðŸš§

OpenStreetMap Vecto is a general-purpose configuration for [Baremaps](https://github.com/baremaps/baremaps).
It is used to generate vector tiles and to produce a Mapbox style inspired by [OpenStreetMap Carto](https://github.com/gravitystorm/openstreetmap-carto).

## Getting started

In order to experiment with OpenStreetMap Vecto, you first need to clone the current repository.

```
git clone git@github.com:baremaps/openstreetmap-vecto.git
cd openstreetmap-vecto/
```

A docker container containing a postgis database and all the tools required to run [Baremaps](https://github.com/baremaps/baremaps) can be started with the following command.
Notice that the current directory is mounted as a volume in the container.

```
docker run -d \
    --name osmvecto \
    --publish 5432:5432 \
    --publish 9000:9000 \
    --volume $(pwd):/home \
    baremaps/osmvecto:latest
```

You then need to import the Natural Earth data and the OpenStreetMap data in the postgis database.
Be patient, depending on your setup importing geospatial data into postgis can take more or less time.

```
docker exec -ti osmvecto bash -c scripts/import.sh
```

You should now be able to start the [Baremaps](https://github.com/baremaps/baremaps) tile server.

```
docker exec -ti osmvecto bash -c scripts/start.sh
```

Your browser ([http://localhost:9000/](http://localhost:9000/)) should now preview OpenStreetMap Vecto.
Notice that a change in the configuration files (`config.yaml`) will automatically be reloaded by the browser.

## Updating the docker image

The following commands are used to publish the docker image.

```
docker build . --tag baremaps/osmvecto
docker push baremaps/osmvecto
```

# OpenStreetMap Vecto

OpenStreetMap Vecto is a general-purpose map inspired by [OpenStreetMap Carto](https://github.com/gravitystorm/openstreetmap-carto).
The configuration files present in this repository can be used with [Baremaps](https://github.com/baremaps/baremaps) to generate vector tiles and a Mapbox style.
